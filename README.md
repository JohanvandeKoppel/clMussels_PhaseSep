# clMussels_PhaseSep

This repository contains the OpenCL code that runs the model describing phase-separation - like self-organisation in mussel beds, as published in:

Liu, Q-X, Doelman, A., Rottsch√§fer, V., De Jager, M., Herman, P.M.J., Rietkerk, M., and Van de Koppel, J. 2013. Phase separation explains a new class of self-organized patterns in ecological systems. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 110 (29): 11905-11910.

An video of the output of the model can be found on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYcXZ7Ho4o8 . This video has been produced by the code in this repository.

To run this model, read the explanation on the main page https://johanvandekoppel.github.io.
